# Full tank
Full tank is the **Facebook Tel-Aviv Hackathon 2018** winning project

In today’s modern life, you can get any product and service right to your doorstep.
Well, actually, every product except one - fuel.

Even Though all companies sell the exact same product, you still have to drive by yourself to a gas station, stand in line and waste time. Not anymore.

Full-Tank brings the gas to your car, and you don’t even need to be there.

Just open the app, let it know until when you won't need the car, how much gas to fuel and which car.
The app already knows your location, and once you make an order - you will get live notifications from the service provider.

That simple!
